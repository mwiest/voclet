# Voclet

Voclet is a mobile application designed to help users learn new vocabulary in a fun and effective way.

## Features

* No sign-up/login, completely local storage, no server sync or anything
* Multiple fun ways of practicing which mostly don't need typing on the keyboard, but still also practice spelling. Rewarding and addictive practice.
* Import and export of word lists for backup and inter-device sharing
* Adding word-lists using the camera and AI to find word pairs on a picture and auto-add them (with a step to fix errors)
* Semi-automatic list creating featuring smart auto-completion and suggested translations
* Language-pair agnostic
* Success-memory and option to practice the difficult words only.
* Option to practice on either multiple, single or sub-sets (by starring certain pairs) of word lists at a time

## Screens

### Home screen

The home screen is a split screen with the word lists on the left, which can be added, imported,
selected and edited.

The right-hand side panel works on the selection on the left-hand side (when nothing is selected it
features a message to select word-lists on the left). Based on the selection, a practice mode
can be started. There are multiple practice modes, each with a visual icon and name. At the bottom,
there is a setting panel to switch the language training direction, whether 1) only starred pairs,
only 2) difficult and new pairs or 3) all pairs are included. 

### Word-list add screen

The Add screen features two tabs:

1. Camera&AI to take a picture of a workbook or similar and have AI figure out languages and word pairs.
2. Manual to add words via keyboard one by one. There is auto-complete and AI translation support, though to ease the process.

### Word-list detail screen

Allows to edit word pairs, add new ones (manually or via camera), delete pairs, export the list
and shows a success score per pair (success rate or the last 10 trainings, counting no training as fails).

### Settings screen

The settings screen allows to set the app theme: System-default (default), light or dark.
It also includes a setting for the UI language and toggles for all practice modes, to be able
to disable/hide certain modes. Also the success statistics can be reset and there's a small
disclaimer/about info section.

### Practicing modes

TBD.
