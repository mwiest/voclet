## Agent collaboration mode
Whenever you need to take a decision that has multiple options, ask me instead of guessing or assuming. When asking explain quickly pros/cons of each option.

Rather to small steps and finish them, instead of trying to build too much at once.

Commit regularly to Git.

When writing tests, do NOT touch non-test code unless explicitly told.
