# Privacy Policy for Voclet

**Effective Date:** February 2026

## Overview

Voclet is a vocabulary learning application that prioritizes your privacy. This policy explains how
the app handles your data.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All your data (word lists, word pairs, practice statistics, and settings) is stored **locally on
your device**. Voclet does not require an account and does not sync data to any external server.

### What is Stored Locally

- Word lists and word pairs you create
- Practice statistics and progress
- App settings (theme preferences)

## Camera Usage

Voclet uses your device camera **only** for the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) feature to scan
word pairs from images (such as textbooks or vocabulary lists).

- Camera access is **optional** and requested only when you choose to use the scan feature
- Images captured are processed and then **immediately discarded**
- Images are **not stored** on your device or sent to any server for storage

## Firebase AI / Google Services

When you use the AI-powered features (scanning word pairs from images or getting translation
suggestions), the following occurs:

- **Images** or **text input** you provide are sent to Google's Firebase AI servers for processing
- This data is processed according to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- Voclet does not store this data beyond the immediate processing need
- You can use Voclet without these AI features by manually entering word pairs or importing from CSV
  files

## Data We Do NOT Collect

Voclet does **not**:

- Collect personal information
- Require account registration
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Display advertisements
- Share any data with third parties (except as described above for AI features)
- Access your contacts, location, or other sensitive device data

## Data Backup

If you enable Android's backup feature, your word lists and settings may be included in your
device's backup to Google Drive. This is controlled by your device settings and Google's privacy
policies.

## Data Export

You can export your word lists at any time using the in-app export feature. Exported files are saved
to a location you choose on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Voclet does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app is suitable for
users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective
Date" above.
